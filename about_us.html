						Who are we?
					</p>
					<p class="entry">
						Formed in 2010, FRC Team #3617 or <i>Team Cold Logic</i> as our members prefer to be called is a consortium of local students and mentors who share in the experience of building and competing with robots within the confines of <a href="http://www.usfirst.org/">FIRST</a> which serves as our parent organization. Following the January kickoff event MSHS students, teaching staff, parent volunteers, industry mentors, and University staff have six weeks to brainstorm, design, build, and test a single functioning robot to compete against other Michigan high school teams in this year's competition.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p class="title">
						Team Cold Logic Mission Statement!
					</p><p class="entry">
						It is our shared vision that participation in FIRST serves as a mechanism for helping students and mentors reach higher levels of personal and academic achievement characteristically attained in competitive events outside of the classroom. Impacts of FRC on students include:
					</p>
					<ul class="entry">
						<li>
							Increased understanding of science &amp; technology in everyday life
						</li>
						<li>
							Learning new and practical work-related skills through teamwork
						</li>
						<li>
							Increased value and understanding of teamwork
						</li>
						<li>
							Increase self-confidence
						</li>
						<li>
							Ability to build upon team success while enabling future career interest in science &amp; technology
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="entry">
						Compared to similar groupings in terms of backgrounds and achievements in high school, FIRST alumni are significantly more likely to attend college and twice as likely to major in science and engineering fields.
					</p>

						What is FRC?
					</p>
					<p class="entry">
						<i>For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology</i>, or FIRST, is an organization founded by inventor <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dean_Kamen">Dean Kamen</a> in 1989 to develop ways to inspire students in engineering and technology fields. The organization is the foundation for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIRST_Robotics_Competition">FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC)</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIRST_Lego_League">FIRST Lego League</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junior_FIRST_Lego_League">Junior FLL</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIRST_Tech_Challenge">FIRST Tech Challenge</a>.

						<i>So... what is unique about the FRC program?</i>
					</p>
					<p class="entry">
						FRC has been touted as a varsity sport for the mind. Working to build a robot under strict guidelines, time restrains, and limited resources is about as close to real-world conditions as students can get which in turn helps prepare them for high-tech and high-demand jobs of the future. Other benefits to FRC include:
					</p>
					<ul class="entry">
						<li>
							Combining the excitement of sports with the rigors of science and technology
						</li>
						<li>
							Participants play and learn alongside career and educational professionals
						</li>
						<li>
							Students learn how to test and implement sophisticated electronic hardware and software.
						</li>
						<li>
							Competitions serve as a proving ground for over $11 million in college scholarships
						</li>
						<li>
							Competitions redefine the term "winning" by rewarding teams for excellence in design, team spirit, gracious professionalism, safety, and ability to overcome obstacles
						</li>
					</ul>
